## Background
---
I've been writing C++ code for the last 15 years (still part of my day job), and while it's served its purpose, I do feel like the language is really showing its age. Newer languages are capable of expressing the same things, with the same level of control and precision one expects of a low level language, without being soul crushing to write/build/manage.

The language is verbose for little benefit; reading templated code doing anything other than type substitution is comparable to staring at the naked sun; it's remarkably slow to build your programs; awkward shoehorning of "language features" into the standard library; far too many angle brackets.

Basically, C++ is not enjoyable for me to write in anymore. I've been looking at alternatives, mainly D and Rust. D has captured my attention currently because of how similar the code looks to C-style syntax, but also because it builds extremely quickly and has very clear and powerful metaprogramming features (I'll get into this).

I haven't had too much of a look at Rust yet, but I will explore that in due time. From what I understand it's about as slow as C++ is with respect to building, so that kills my interest somewhat.

## What's cool about D?
---
More than any singular feature I can point to, it's the cumulative effect of lots of small improvements and differences.

### Ecosystem:
- BUILDS SO FAST
- Has a standarised package management / build system called [dub](https://github.com/dlang/dub)
- Has a built-in documentation syntax and tools to generate documentation pages from your code
- Unit testing is built into the language and tools
- The runtime has a standardised thread pool, so no more BYO threadpool for every 3rd party library/code that's running
- Generate fast code with ldc2 (uses llvm for codegen)
- GCC 9 has support for D!
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/MacOS)

### Language:
- Extremely powerful, readable, metaprogramming with human readable errors
- Built-in slice data type. This sounds like a small thing but really makes coding *much more enjoyable*
- The standard library is based on ranges, not iterators
- Supports mixins, which allow you to do more while writing less
- [Unified Function Call Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax) means there's no difference between a function and a method. Another thing that just *makes me feel happier*
- Supports inline assembly (unlike 64-bit MSVC), for all the weird stuff you need to do

### Doesn't it have garbage collection?
The rumours are true, but this is barely a problem in practice. You have access to the libc malloc/free routines, which aren't tracked by the GC, so you can manage the memory yourself (I'll post my findings on this), or just disable the GC via `GC.disable;`.

Besides, I've seen enough C++ code that's proliferated with shared pointers to the degree where they have de facto garbage collection anyway.

### Show me some code!
Most certainly

## An n-dimensional vector

Since my work is in computer graphics, lets create every CG programmer's favourite data type, a 3 dimensional vector:
```c++
struct Vec3f
{
    float x, y, z;
};
```
