## Background
---
I've been writing C++ code for the last 15 years (still part of my day job), and while it's served its purpose, I do feel like the language is really showing its age. Newer languages are capable of expressing the same things, with the same level of control and precision one expects of a low level language, without being soul crushing to write/build/manage.

The language is verbose for little benefit; reading templated code doing anything other than type substitution is comparable to staring at the naked sun; it's remarkably slow to build your programs; awkward shoehorning of "language features" into the standard library; far too many angle brackets.

Basically, C++ is not enjoyable for me to write in anymore. I've been looking at alternatives, mainly D and Rust. D has captured my attention currently because of how similar the code looks to C-style syntax, but also because it builds extremely quickly and has very clear and powerful metaprogramming features (I'll get into this).

I haven't had too much of a look at Rust yet, but I will explore that in due time. From what I understand it's about as slow as C++ is with respect to building, so that kills my interest somewhat.

## What's cool about D?
---
More than any singular feature I can point to, it's the cumulative effect of lots of small improvements and differences.

### Ecosystem:
- BUILDS SO FAST
- Has a standarised package management / build system called [dub](https://github.com/dlang/dub)
- Has a built-in documentation syntax and tools to generate documentation pages from your code
- Unit testing is built into the language and tools
- The runtime has a standardised thread pool, so no more BYO threadpool for every 3rd party library/code that's running
- Generate fast code with ldc2 (uses llvm for codegen)
- GCC 9 has support for D!
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/MacOS)

### Language:
- Extremely powerful, readable, metaprogramming with human readable errors
- Built-in slice data type. This sounds like a small thing but really makes coding *much more enjoyable*
- The standard library is based on ranges, not iterators
- Supports mixins, which allow you to do more while writing less
- [Unified Function Call Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax) means there's no difference between a function and a method. Another thing that just *makes me feel happier*
- Supports inline assembly (unlike 64-bit MSVC), for all the weird stuff you need to do

### Doesn't it have garbage collection?
The rumours are true, but this is barely a problem in practice. You have access to the libc malloc/free routines, which aren't tracked by the GC, so you can manage the memory yourself (I'll post my findings on this), or just disable the GC via `GC.disable;`.

Besides, I've seen enough C++ code that's proliferated with shared pointers to the degree where they have de facto garbage collection anyway.

### Show me some code!
Most certainly

## Examples

### N-dimensional vector
Since my work is in computer graphics, lets create every CG programmer's favourite data type, a 3 dimensional vector:
```c++
// C++
struct Vec3f
{
    float x, y, z;
};
```

Since we do a lot of algebra with the vec3f, it's convenient to overload common math operators like `+`, `*`, `-`, `/`, etc... it would look something like this:
```c++
// C++
struct Vec3f
{
    float x, y, z;

    /// constructor omitted

    inline Vec3f operator+( const Vec3f& v ) const
    {
        return Vec3f( x + v.x, y + v.y, z + v.z );
    }

    /// I know you can't multiply two vectors, but a component-wise product is handy
    inline Vec3f operator*( const Vec3f& v ) const
    {
        return Vec3f( x*v.x, y*v.y, z*v.z );
    }

    //// Similar code is needed to support -, and /

};
```

You need to add in all of those little operator functions, that's not even including operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`. which need their own implementations as well.

That's a lot of code to have to write, and this is only for Vec3f! It isn't uncommon to have another bunch of this boilerplate for a 2D, or 4D vector (Vec2f, Vec4f). More typing also means more room for errors, which can be annoying to track down at this level, unless you're unit testing all of this.

Here is the equivalent in D
```d
// D
struct Vec3f
{
    float x, y, z;

    /// initialiser omitted

    /// all binary operations with this type go through this function
    pure const Vec3f opBinary( string op )( Vec3f rhs )
    {
        return mixin( "Vec3f( x "~op~" rhs.x, y "~op~" rhs.y, z "~op~" rhs.z );" );
    }
}
```

Wait, what just happened. That opBinary is actually called for *any* binary operation called on the Vec3f type. The function itself is templated (notice the two sets of paranthesis), the `string op` being the template parameter, which is a string known at compile time. So the operation `a + b`, where `a`, and `b` are Vec3f's, translates into `a.opBinary!("+")( b );` The ! is required before setting a template parameter in D (no angle brackets).

We're also seeing `mixin` and `~`. The `~` is doing string concatenation here (`~` is for concatenation of any kind), so we get this line in the function `return mixin( "Vec3f( x + rhs.x, y + rhs.y, z + rhs.z);" );`. The `mixin` takes the input string and literally inserts it as code at compile time. It's very powerful.
