### Background
---
I've been writing C++ code for the last 15 years (still part of my day job), and while it's served its purpose, I do feel like the language is really showing its age. Newer languages are capable of expressing the same things, with the same level of control and precision one expects of a low level language, without being soul crushing to type. The language is verbose for not much benefit; looking at templated code doing anything other than type substitution is comparable to staring at the naked sun; it's remarkably slow to build your programs; awkward shoehorning of "language features" into the standard library; far too many angle brackets.

Basically, C++ is not enjoyable for me to write in anymore. I've been looking at alternatives, mainly D and Rust. D has captured my attention currently because of how similar the code looks to C-style syntax, but also because it builds extremely quickly and has very clear and powerful metaprogramming features (I'll get into this). I haven't had too much of a look at Rust yet, but I will explore that in due time.
