# About me
I'm a professional software engineer in the VFX industry who has a passion for mathematics, physics, rendering and art. This blog serves as a place for me to share things I've learned, or have been tinkering with. Hopefully this can be a good learning experience for others, or at the very least it can be a place for me to scream into the void.
